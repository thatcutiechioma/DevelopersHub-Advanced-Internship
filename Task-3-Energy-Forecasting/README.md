# Task 3: Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

## Objective
Forecast short-term household energy consumption using historical time series data.

## Dataset
Household Power Consumption Dataset

## Approach
- Parsed and cleaned time series data
- Created a datetime index
- Resampled data to daily averages
- Trained a Prophet forecasting model
- Evaluated performance using MAE and RMSE

## Results
The Prophet model captured overall energy consumption trends and produced a reasonable short-term forecast.
